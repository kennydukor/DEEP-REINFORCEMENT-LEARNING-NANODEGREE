# DEEP-REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-NANODEGREE 

The Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program is divided into four parts, giving you a thorough understanding of deep reinforcement learning, and covering some of the major topics.

## Part 1: Foundations of Reinforcement Learning
The first part begins with a simple introduction to reinforcement learning. You'll learn how to define real-world problems as **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**, so that they can be solved with reinforcement learning.

Then, you'll implement classical methods such as **SARSA** and **Q-learning** to solve several environments in OpenAI Gym. You'll then explore how to use techniques such as **tile coding** and **coarse coding** to expand the size of the problems that can be solved with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.
